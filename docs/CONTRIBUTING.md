## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- macOS (primary target platform)
- Git and GitHub account
- Basic familiarity with shell scripting and Ansible

### Fork and Clone
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
git remote add upstream git@github.com:wpearson/dotfiles.git
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Test your changes safely
ansible-playbook -i hosts local_env.yml --check --diff --tags your-role

# Use a test branch
git checkout -b feature/your-improvement
```

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

**Shell Scripts**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail  # Exit on error, undefined vars, pipe failures

# Use clear variable names
readonly SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

# Functions should be documented
setup_environment() {
    # Brief description of what this does
    local config_file="$1"
    # Implementation
}
```

**Ansible Roles**:
```yaml
---
# Use descriptive task names
- name: Install development tools via Homebrew
  homebrew:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop: "{{ dev_packages }}"
  tags: ['development', 'homebrew']

# Include appropriate tags and when conditions
- name: Configure Git signing key
  git_config:
    name: user.signingkey
    value: "{{ gpg_key_id }}"
  when: gpg_key_id is defined
```

**Documentation**:
- Use clear headings and sections
- Include code examples for complex procedures
- Test all documented commands
- Keep the tone friendly but professional

### Testing Your Changes

**Required Tests**:
```bash
# 1. Ansible syntax check
ansible-playbook -i hosts local_env.yml --syntax-check

# 2. Dry-run to check for issues
ansible-playbook -i hosts local_env.yml --check --diff

# 3. Test specific roles
ansible-playbook -i hosts local_env.yml --tags your-role --check

# 4. Full test run (on a test system/VM if possible)
./bin/dot-bootstrap
```

**Additional Validation**:
- Verify shell scripts with `shellcheck`
- Test documentation steps manually
- Ensure compatibility with latest macOS
- Check that customizations don't break core functionality

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Include appropriate documentation updates
- Add or update tests as needed

### 3. Test Thoroughly
```bash
# Test your specific changes
ansible-playbook -i hosts local_env.yml --tags your-role --check

# Test the full setup (preferably on a clean system)
./bin/dot-bootstrap
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes
```bash
# Use conventional commit format
git commit -m "feat: add support for new development tool"
git commit -m "fix: resolve homebrew permission issue"
git commit -m "docs: improve installation guide clarity"
```

```yaml
# Example: Adding a new development tool
# 1. Create role structure
mkdir roles/your-tool/{tasks,defaults,files,templates}

# 2. Implement installation and configuration
# tasks/main.yml
- name: Install your-tool
  homebrew:
    name: your-tool
    state: present

# 3. Add to main playbook
# local_env.yml
- role: your-tool
  tags: ['your-tool', 'development']

# 4. Document in appropriate README
```

### Improving Existing Roles
- Add new configuration options
- Improve error handling
- Add conditional logic for different scenarios
- Enhance documentation

### Script Improvements
- Better error handling
- More user-friendly output
- Additional functionality
- Performance optimizations

### Documentation Enhancements
- Clearer explanations
- More examples
- Better organization
- Fix typos and errors

## üß™ Advanced Testing

### Test on Different Systems
- Fresh macOS installation
- Existing development environment
- Different macOS versions (if possible)

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Time the full setup
time ./bin/dot-bootstrap

# Check for unnecessary operations
ansible-playbook -i hosts local_env.yml --check --diff | grep changed
```

### Security Review
- No hardcoded secrets in commits
- Proper file permissions
- Secure default configurations
- Validate external script sources

## üìö Documentation Standards

### Code Comments
```bash
# Explain WHY, not just WHAT
# Good:
# Set stricter permissions to prevent accidental modification
chmod 600 "$config_file"

# Less helpful:
# Change file permissions
chmod 600 "$config_file"
```

### README Updates
When adding new features:
1. Update main README.md if it affects the overview
2. Update role-specific READMEs
3. Add to FEATURES.md if it's a user-facing feature
4. Update CUSTOMIZATION.md if it's configurable

### Variable Documentation
```yaml
# In defaults/main.yml, document complex variables
development_packages:
  # Core development tools for daily workflow
  - git
  - ansible
  
  # Modern CLI replacements for better UX
  - eza      # Enhanced 'ls' with icons and git status
  - bat      # 'cat' with syntax highlighting
```
