## Quick Commands

### Deployment
```bash
# Deploy Week 2 services
ansible-playbook -i hosts remote_env.yml --tags week2

# Deploy specific service
ansible-playbook -i hosts remote_env.yml --tags homeassistant
ansible-playbook -i hosts remote_env.yml --tags camera-system
ansible-playbook -i hosts remote_env.yml --tags monitoring
```

### Monitoring
```bash
# Check service status
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"

# Check resource usage
docker stats --no-stream

# Check temperature
pmset -g thermlog | tail -5
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
# Service logs
docker logs homeassistant
docker logs frigate
docker logs uptime-kuma

# Storage health
df -h /Volumes/HomeServerStorage
sudo /opt/homebrew/bin/storage-health.sh
```
